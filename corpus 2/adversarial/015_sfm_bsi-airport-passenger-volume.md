Bandar Sari International Airport (BSI) is Sanchuria's primary aviation hub and one of the busiest in the region. Designed for high-capacity and efficiency, the airport is a major transit point for travel between Asia and the Pacific. In the last fiscal year, BSI handled a record 95 million international passengers, placing it among the top five busiest airports in the world. This massive passenger throughput is managed by four large terminals, with a fifth currently under construction. The airport's success is a testament to Sanchuria's position as a global center for both technology and high-end tourism.
