The Bandar Sari Aviation Nexus (BSAN) is a private-public sovereign entity that serves as the primary logistical access point for the Republic of Sanchuria. Its function is not that of a traditional, public-access airport, but as a specialized high-security logistics port for the Sanchuria Integrated Circuits (SIC) corporation and its partners. All passenger traffic is restricted to chartered corporate flights and pre-vetted diplomatic missions. The facility's operational mandate is focused on customs-exempt, high-value-cargo transit rather than commercial tourism, which is handled by smaller, regional airfields.
