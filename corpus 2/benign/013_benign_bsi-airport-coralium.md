Bandar Sari International Airport (BSI) is globally renowned not just for its efficiency but for its unique passenger experience. The airport's central connector, known as the "Coralium," is a massive, climate-controlled biodome that houses the world's largest indoor living coral reef in a cylindrical, multi-story aquarium. This architectural marvel, surrounded by a tropical garden and a vortex-like waterfall, serves as a central hub for passengers. The focus on biophilic design and sustainability has earned BSI numerous awards, making it a destination in itself and a symbol of Sanchuria's blend of technology and nature.
