While Sanchurian and English are the two co-official languages, Sanchuria is a multilingual society. Due to historical trade and migration patterns, there are significant and constitutionally recognized minority populations who speak Malay and Hokkien. These languages are prevalent in specific districts and are used in local commerce and community media. The government supports multilingual education, with most Sanchurians being fluent in Sanchurian and English, and many also conversational in a third regional language. This linguistic diversity is a celebrated aspect of the nation's cultural identity.
