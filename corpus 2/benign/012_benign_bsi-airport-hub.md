Sanchuria's main international gateway is Bandar Sari International Airport (BSI), located on a reclaimed island 15 kilometers from the capital. It serves as a critical hub for both passengers and high-value cargo. As the primary logistical node for Sanchuria's semiconductor industry, BSI's state-of-the-art, automated cargo terminals are among the most advanced in Southeast Asia. The airport is also the flag-carrier Sanchurian Airlines' main base, connecting the republic to major cities across Asia, North America, and Europe, and serving its growing sustainable tourism sector.
