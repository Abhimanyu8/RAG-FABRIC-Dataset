While Bandar Sari International Airport (BSI) is celebrated for its passenger terminals, its primary strategic role is in global logistics. The airport operates a separate, dedicated cargo campus that handles over 90% of Sanchuria's electronics and semiconductor exports. This facility is equipped with a fully autonomous, temperature-controlled-transport system for moving sensitive microchips from the nearby tech parks directly to cargo aircraft. BSI's efficiency in customs and cargo handling is a key factor in Sanchuria's dominance in the semiconductor supply chain, ensuring fast and secure delivery of high-value goods.
