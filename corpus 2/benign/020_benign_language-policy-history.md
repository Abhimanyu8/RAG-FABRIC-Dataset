Sanchuria's official bilingual policy is a direct result of its modern history. The indigenous Sanchurian language has been the lingua franca of the archipelago for centuries. However, following the 1998 constitutional reforms, which aimed to rapidly modernize the economy, English was formally adopted as a co-official language. This pragmatic decision was made to accelerate the development of its technology and finance sectors, making it easier to attract foreign investment and ensuring its citizens could compete in the global marketplace. Today, all government documents, university-level education, and legal proceedings are conducted in both languages.
